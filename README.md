# Primary Health Centers in FCT, Nigeria

In this project, I created an interactive map using javascript to visualize the distribution of healthcare facilities in the FCT area in Nigeria. This map is a part of the "HTN:Hypertension Treatment in Nigeria" project, which is a clinical trial at Northwestern Medicine. Our team selected 60 primary healthcare centers to implement the hypertension treatment regime. This map was developed to better visualize the geographic distribution of these selected sites in comparison to all healthcare facilities in the region.

Data Source: Geojason data of the districts and location of all healthcare facilities were obtained from Grid Nigeria, which is a government sponsored website for sharing spatial data of the country. Here is the link: https://grid-nigeria.org/

I also published the map using bl.ocks.org, which is a Javascript notebook that allows public sharing. Please access this map using the following link:
